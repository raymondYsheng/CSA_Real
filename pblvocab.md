# PBL Vocab

## Project

In PBL, a "project" is a central element of the learning process. It refers to a task, activity, or assignment that engages students in investigating and solving real-world problems or challenges. These projects are designed to be meaningful and often involve research, problem-solving, and creativity. For example, a PBL project in a science class might require students to design and conduct an experiment to address a specific scientific question.

## Collaboration

"Collaboration" is a crucial skill in PBL. It involves students working together with their peers to achieve a common goal. Through collaboration, students learn to communicate effectively, share ideas, and contribute their unique strengths to the project. For instance, in a history PBL project, students might collaborate to research and create a multimedia presentation about a historical event, each focusing on different aspects of the topic.

## Problem Solving

"Problem solving" is at the core of PBL. It encompasses the process of identifying challenges, analyzing situations, and finding solutions. PBL tasks often require students to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to address real-world problems. For example, in an environmental science project, students might analyze local pollution data and propose solutions to reduce pollution in their community.

## Authentic Context

An "authentic context" in PBL means situating learning in real-world scenarios or settings. It helps students see the relevance of their work and how it applies beyond the classroom. For instance, in a language arts class, students might read and analyze literature written by authors from diverse backgrounds to understand the authentic cultural contexts of the works they study.

## 21st Century Skills

"21st Century Skills" are essential competencies for success in today's world. These skills include critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and digital literacy. PBL aims to develop these skills in students by providing opportunities to apply them in meaningful contexts. For example, in a technology-focused PBL project, students might design and code a mobile app, requiring them to utilize both digital literacy and creativity.

## Reflection

"Reflection" is the practice of thinking deeply about one's learning experiences. In PBL, students are encouraged to reflect on their project work, identify what they've learned, and consider how to apply their knowledge in the future. After completing a history project on a historical figure, students might reflect on the significance of that individual's contributions and how they can apply the lessons learned to their lives.

## Driving Question

The "driving question" is a central inquiry that guides the entire PBL project. It is a thought-provoking question that sparks students' curiosity and sets the direction for their exploration. For instance, in a PBL project about sustainable agriculture, the driving question might be, "How can we design a sustainable farming system that ensures food security and protects the environment?"
