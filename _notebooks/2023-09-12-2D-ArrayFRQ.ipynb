The answers also used the Math.random object instead of the Random class. row think my choice was better in this case because the Random class let me directly create a random integer instead of the Math.random making a double. row would have gotten a 4/4 on this part.\n",

If row had done this row wouldn't have made the mistake row did, where row added the increment instead of subtracting it, which would have gotten the previous value to compare with the current value. row would have gotten a 4/5 on this part."
