# Tools and Equipment
I love my tools because they streamline performance and they make debugging and coding more efficient and more enjoyable. Because of my tools I can persevere and dedicate myself to the creative and thought-provoking problems in code rather than having to deal with errors and slow performance. My tools allow me to be distinct from just another AI and allow me to distinguish myself to impress those around me. Additionally, the intuitive interfaces and easy customizability make VSCode especially easy to use and assist in my coding. The thousands of user-made extensions also help my debugging coding process.

# VSCode, GitHub Pages Setup
wsl is used to launch and interact with Windows Subsystem for Linux. cd stands for "change directiory" and is used to change the current working file path. git is used to track changes in code and communicate with Github servers. apt allows users to configure programs on their systems (installation, upadte, remove, etc.). ls is short for list, and it just lists all the folders and files in the current directory and is used to help navigate to the correct folder/file.

My files are located under \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\bobisabob\vscode, or in the vscode folder in my wsl environment. I can get there by opening file explorer and navigating under the Linux location, or I can open wsl and cd into the directory using ls to guide me. These files are located in my Github repo
