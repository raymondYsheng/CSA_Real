The answers also used the Math.random object instead of the Random class. I think my choice was better in this case because the Random class let me directly create a random integer instead of the Math.random making a double. I would have gotten a 4/4 on this part.\n",

    ">> For part B, instead of breaking or continuing a loop and creating a label, I could have added a boolean that determines whether the elements in the column are already ordered. I also should have labelled the loop variables \"column\" and \"row\" instead of i and j so that it is easier to understand and work with. If I had done this I wouldn't have made the mistake I did, where I added the increment instead of subtracting it, which would have gotten the previous value to compare with the current value. I would have gotten a 4/5 on this part."
