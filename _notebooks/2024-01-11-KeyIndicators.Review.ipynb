Namely, as a historically primary backend worker, the JWT lesson and the Thymeleaf research that I did were very useful to me. However, since I want to be well-rounded, I also found SASS very helpful for boosting UX, and jQuery's utility to simplify Javascript that links the backend and frontend was very useful. "

    "### First Project: Whack-A-Mole\n",
    "This was my first project for CSA and in this class format. I was working with a new coding system and it was an opportunity to help me get acquainted with all the tools in CSA. I used it to brush up on my web development.\n",

    "For my final project from last year, we worked together to create diagrams for our project structure. \n",
    "- [Spacebook Ideation Diagram](https://github.com/Cosmic-Carnage/Issues/issues/17)\n",
    "We also all worked on our overall project. I was the primary backend developer, and I worked on the structure for the Leaderboard API, as well as the file upload code. At this point I was really easing into the spring and it took me a while to get used to the structure behind APIs. In this project, my most proud accomplishment was bringing in HashMaps, which was the data strucutre that we primarily used later in the project and gave us all some experience with the structure before the student lesson this year.\n",
    "- [Spacebook](https://cosmic.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### CryptoCrunch\n",
    "I was responsible for the majority of the backend development in our Mini-Project this trimester. In doing so, I ran into numerous issues while trying to implement sorting with something we were passionate about: cryptocurrency. I documented some of my struggles and some of the breakthroughs that I had. In it, I created the bulk of the sorting methods and the ideation, and I was most proud of using switch cases when deciding with method to call from the api.\n",
    "- [Problem Struggles for CryptoCrunch](https://github.com/divorced-coders/NewBooksBackend/issues/2)\n",
    "Generally, this was probably my least favorite project because I don't think we really explored enough of what we were looking into and had to focus on finding valid crypto APIs rather than learning about the nature of cryptocurrency.\n"
