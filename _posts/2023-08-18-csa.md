# Tools and Equipment
I love my tools because they streamline performance and they make debugging and coding more efficient and more enjoyable. Because of my tools I can persevere and dedicate myself to the creative and thought-provoking problems in code rather than having to deal with errors and slow performance. My tools allow me to be distinct from just another AI and allow me to distinguish myself to impress those around me. Additionally, the intuitive interfaces and easy customizability make VSCode especially easy to use and assist in my coding. The thousands of user-made extensions also help my debugging coding process.
